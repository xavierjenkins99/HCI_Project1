# Issues with Old Design

* Not very helpful for the blind.
* Gives too many options, instead of being right to the point.
* Numbered buttons are on the bottom when they should be at the top, since
  is what people want to click on first in a hurry.
* The buttons are flat and don't offer much in tactile feedback to user when pressed.
* If a person has vision problems, some of the text might be hard to read when combined with certain colors.
* User can find themsleves hitting the wrong button due to their size and proximity to one another.
* Only displays the time on the LED screen, not giving those who are **viusally impaired** much assistance when it comes to seeing how much time is left.


# Improved Design

# What's in the new design?

## The Numpad:

1. Has been made simpler and cleaner for most user's to see and read
2. Buttons and font is much bigger than before
3. Organized so that the numbers take priority and are on top of the command buttons
4. **Raised Bumps** have been added to the buttons that will give visually impaired users the same access to the microwave as others.
5. A planned but not implemented option of having a speaker on the side which (when toggled on or off) will say the countdown time every minute passed. This is to further assist those who are visually impaired.
6. Give a small vibration/sound when a button is pressed so the user knows they have clicked a button on the interface.
