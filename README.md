# Issues with Old Design

* Not very helpful for the blind.
* Gives too many options, instead of being right to the point.
* Numbered buttons are on the bottom when they should be at the top, since
  is what people want to click on first in a hurry.
* The buttons are flat and don't offer much in tactile feedback to user when pressed.
* If a person has vision problems, some of the text might be hard to read when combined with certain colors.
* User can find themsleves hitting the wrong button due to their size and proximity to one another.
* Only displays the time on the LED screen, not giving those who are viusally impaored much assistance when it comes to seeing how much time is left.
